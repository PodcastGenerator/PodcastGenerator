*******
This guide assumes there is a fresh install of Ubuntu 20.04.3 and that the user initially logs into the server as the root user.

### Access Your Server
1. Open your local machine or login via ssh:

2. Create a system user:

`adduser replace_with_your_username`

3. Add the new user to the sudo group:

`usermod -aG sudo replace_with_your_username`

4. Login with user:

`su replace_with_your_username`

5. Add port 22 and 80 to the firewall rules and enable:

`sudo ufw allow 80`

`sudo ufw allow 22`

`sudo ufw enable`

`sudo ufw status`

All active rules should then be shown.

6. Update system:

`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`

7. Install PHP and unzip:

`sudo apt install php php-cli php-fpm php-json php-pdo php-mysql php-zip php-gd php-mbstring php-curl php-xml php-pear php-bcmath unzip`

8. Confirm PHP version:

`php --version`

Output should look like:

```PHP 7.2.24-0ubuntu0.18.04.6 (cli) (built: May 26 2020 13:09:11) ( NTS )

14. Cleanup by removing unneccessary files:
