# Contributing to Podcast Generator
Hello ðŸ‘‹ and thanks for the interest to contribute code to Podcast Generator.
There are several ways of contributing to Podcast Generator. These are:
* Write code
* Report and search for bugs and security issues
* Translate
* Request features

## Write code
If you want to write code we have no real formal guidelines. You will be
highly assisted when creating the pull request. However there are some things
you should keep in mind. These are especially:
* Atomic commits and pull requests
* Keep the diffs small
* Keep backwards compatibility in mind when writing the code
* Keep string translation in mind

If you have no ideas on what to work on, feel free to go to the
GitHub issue tracker and work on the milestone for the next version.
Those issues always have high-priority. Otherwise feel free to fix
a bug or implement a feature request.

## Report and search for bugs and security issues
If you found a bug, please report it on GitHub. Please
make it others as easy as possible to reproduce that bug.
If you found a security issue PLEASE DO NOT open an issue on GitHub.
Instead have a look at [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

## Translate
If you speak a language that is not english, head over to
[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/albertobeta/podcast-generator/)

## Request features
We are open to any kind of features ðŸ˜ƒ

PGP signed commits are accepted
