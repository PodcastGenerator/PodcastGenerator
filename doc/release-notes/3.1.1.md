## Notes on this release
Fixes to security issues in Podcast Generator 3.1

## Prerequisites
You will need a version of Podcast Generator that is equal to or higher than

## How to upgrade
**Be sure to make a backup before updating!**
1. Download the release
2. Extract the ZIP-Archive
3. Enter the directory (There are lots of meta files (license stuff for example, `PodcastGenerator/` is what you are looking for))
4. Upload the PodcastGenerator folder, or it's content to your desired location on your web server.
5. If necessary, adjust permissions by `chmod -R 775 PodcastGenerator/` (if you don't know what file permissions and have no access to a shell you can ignore this step)
6. Point your web browser to your website where Podcast Generator is installed.
7. You will get prompted by an assistant which asks you to enter your password
8. There you go, enjoy the new version of Podcast Generator.

## Compatibility
Podcast Generator 3 was developed with `PHP 7.3.11`. In general all `PHP 7+` versions should work. However it is unknown if it will work with `PHP 5` but you shouldn't use PHP5 either as it has reached it's end of life and is just a potential security risk.
It was developed using `PHP 7.3.11` on `GNU/Linux Debian Buster` using `nginx`. It should be independent of the OS and web server though. If you expect any problems, please report them at [GitHub](https://github.com/PodcastGenerator/PodcastGenerator/issues). We will try our best to publish a new version as fast as possible to fix this bug
